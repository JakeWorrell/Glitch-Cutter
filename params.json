{"name":"Glitch-cutter","body":"Glitch Cutter\r\n=============\r\n\r\nGlitch Cutter will randomly create small audio files made from a tiny part of your other audio files. It does so randomly in a batch as large as you specify. The code isn't particularly nice, but it works.\r\n\r\nI created it to create abstract sounds to be used as instruments in [Renoise](http://www.renoise.com). I also just thought it seemed like a good idea at the time.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n * PHP 5.3\r\n * a unix/linux based CLI with 'find' & 'grep' (tested on my Macbook Pro with OSX 10.7.3)\r\n * [SOX](http://sox.sourceforge.net/Main/HomePage) (which is awesome, by the way)\r\n * (optional) a [Wordnik](http://www.wordnik.com/) API key for creating memorable output folder names\r\n\r\nHow To Use\r\n----------\r\n * cp config-example.php config.php and optionally add your wordnik API key\r\n * change any other things you need in config.php (eg, source directory)\r\n * php go.php","tagline":"A little php script that uses SOX to randomly grab small bits of audio files and put them into new files.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
